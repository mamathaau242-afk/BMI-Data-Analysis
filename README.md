**BMI Data Analysis**

This repository contains an analysis of **Body Mass Index (BMI)** data collected from individuals across different age groups, genders, diet types, and physical activity levels. 
The project explores correlations between BMI, age, gender, and lifestyle factors using Excel-based calculations and pivot tables.

**Project Contents**

-**Dataset (Excel file)**: Includes raw data of individuals with attributes such as age, gender, height, weight, diet type, and physical activity level.
-**BMI Calculations**: Height converted to meters, BMI computed using the formula:
[
  BMI = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
]
-**Pivot Tables**: Summarized insights on BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) across age groups and genders.
-**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Highlighting average BMI, % overweight, % obese, and outlier detection.

**Key Observations**

-**Average BMI across the dataset**:22(Normal range).
-**BMI vs Age**: BMI tends to increase with age, peaking in the **41–60** age group.
-**Gender differences**: Females show slightly higher average BMI than males in the **41–60** bracket.
-**Distribution**:
  - 18% of individuals are Overweight
  - 7% are Obese
  - Majority fall in the Normal BMI range
**Outliers**: No extreme BMI values (>40) detected, ensuring data consistency.

**Pivot Table Insights**

-**Normal vs Obese**: Normal group is over **8× larger** than Obese.
-**Underweight vs Overweight**: Nearly equal, differing by only 5 individuals.

-**Age Group Trends**:
  - 0–20 years: Higher proportion of underweight individuals.
  - 41–60 years: Peak BMI values.
  -61+ years: Smaller sample size but still within normal range.
